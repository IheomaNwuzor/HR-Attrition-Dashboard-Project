# Introduction
This project introduces a data-driven HR Attrition Dashboard designed to deliver actionable insights into employee turnover patterns within an organisation. By visualising key metrics such as attrition rates, demographics, job roles, departmental data, and employee feedback. The dashboard allows HR professionals and business leaders to make evidence-based decisions for workforce planning and employee retention.
The main goal of this project is to create an interactive visualisation tool that helps understand and address the factors behind employee attrition. Its specific objectives include:
• Analyse attrition trends across departments and job roles
• Investigate demographic influences like age and gender on attrition
• Explore links between job satisfaction, pay, and turnover
• Present recent cases of attrition with key influencing variables
• Offer a strategic overview to improve HR interventions

# Rationale
Employee attrition remains one of the most costly and disruptive issues organisations face. Understanding why employees leave and identifying those most at risk are essential for developing effective retention strategies. This project simulates a real-world scenario where HR data is transformed into a visual narrative, highlighting problem areas and uncovering patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed in tabular data.

# Deliverables
The project produces a cleaned and structured HR dataset with employee-level details. Additionally, a fully functional HR Attrition Dashboard was developed using Microsoft Excel for initial data cleaning, aggregation, dashboard creation, and interactive visualisations.

# Conclusions
This HR Attrition Dashboard illustrates the value of visual analytics in workforce management. It enables HR stakeholders to identify attrition patterns, examine them alongside job satisfaction and demographic data, and make informed policy adjustments. The dashboard is modular, scalable, and adaptable to organisational datasets, making it a valuable addition to any HR analytics toolkit.
