# Optimising Employee Retention and Performance at Talent-Pulse Solutions Inc
Problem Statement for the Talent-Pulse Solutions Inc. Employee Retention  

## Background 

Talent-Pulse Solutions Inc. is a forward-thinking organisation dedicated to empowering businesses through strategic workforce management. As a leader in talent optimisation, the company prides itself on fostering an environment where employees can thrive. However, recent challenges with employee retention and workforce engagement have highlighted the need for actionable insights. 

## Current Challenges

1. Business Challenge
•	High Attrition Rates: The organisation is experiencing above-normal employee turnover, which can lead to increased recruitment and training costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and disruption of workflows.
•	Impact on Productivity: Frequent employee exits affect team stability and reduce overall productivity. Employees who stay may feel overburdened, impacting morale and efficiency.
•	Organizational Performance Risk: High attrition weakens the organisation’s ability to achieve long-term strategic goals, as continuous workforce instability limits growth and innovation.
2. Data Gaps / Understanding Issues
•	Limited Trend Visibility: Current reporting does not provide a clear, comprehensive picture of attrition across departments, demographics, or employee tenure groups.
•	Fragmented Insights: Attrition-related information is scattered and not easily integrated, making it difficult for leadership to monitor patterns or compare workforce segments.
•	Lack of Benchmarking: The company does not have a clear baseline or benchmark for acceptable attrition rates by department or role, making it harder to measure performance accurately.
3. Analytical Challenge
•	Unclear Drivers of Attrition: The organisation struggles to identify the root causes behind employee exits (e.g., compensation, career progression, work environment, leadership issues).
•	Survey Data Limitations: Employee surveys have shown low scores, but the organisation lacks analytical tools to connect these results to attrition outcomes.
•	Reactive Instead of Proactive: Current analysis focuses on historical attrition rather than predictive insights, preventing HR teams from intervening early with at-risk employees.

## Aim
This project aims to leverage data analysis and visualisation techniques to gain actionable insights into employee attrition, enabling HR teams to understand and uncover key trends, underlying patterns, optimise employee satisfaction, and make strategic, evidence-based decisions to improve retention and enhance overall organisational performance.

## Objectives

•	To identify key trends and factors contributing to employee attrition. 
•	Analyse workforce demographics by department, gender, age group, and education level to understand patterns. 
•	Track attrition trends over time and compare survey scores with employee turnover rates. 
•	Build a comprehensive dashboard to enable HR teams to make data-driven decisions

## Analytical Questions

1. Attrition Rate
•	What is the overall attrition rate, and how does it compare across departments?
2. Total Attrition
•	What is the total number of employees who left the organisation?
•	How does this break down by job role and tenure?
3. Current Employees
•	How many employees are currently in each department?
4. Department Demographics
•	What is the distribution of employees across departments by gender, age group, and educational field?
•	Are there any departments with significantly skewed demographics?
5. Attrition Trend
•	How has employee attrition changed by the number of years in role?
6. Demographics by Gender, Age Group, and Educational Level/Field
•	What are the attrition rates for different demographics?
•	Do certain groups exhibit higher turnover than others?
7. Survey Score
•	How do employee survey scores correlate with attrition?
8. Recent Attrition
•	Who are the most recent employees to leave the organisation?
•	What patterns emerge when analysing this subset?

## Detailed Steps

o	Dataset cleaning and formatting.

o	Joining tables on Freelancer_ID and job earnings.
